    <h2>Family Trips</h2>
<p>Our Women’s travel club, Kolkata, an all-women’s group is doing fabulously well. All our upcoming trips are nearly full. It has been a tremendous experience for us to cater to the needs of our members and clients successfully and that is reflected through our achievements. Now we are getting lots and lots of requests to start family tours where male partners can also join our tour programmmes. So after through discussion it was finalized that a separate Facebook & Whatsapp Group will be come into existence for all family trips. That’s how “Family trips from Kolkata” was born. It will be managed by experienced partners, Jhumur Nandy & Manas Nandy.
