    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>It all started on the day, 20th January, 2019, a bunch of Facebook friends with a common interest got togehter and went for a tour. Never thought this path will lead to something so big. One trip after another and with my love of writing of travelogues attracted many more friends with a common interest to travel and explore new places. That’s how Facebook group of “Women’s Travel Club Kolkata” was born in April, 2019 managed by Jhumur Nandy.

        <h2>Mission & Vision</h2>
        <p>The group was formed to enable solo women travellers to chase their dreams and passion for travel and explore new places and also to build a community for all who loves adventure and want to experience the vivid cultural diversity of our country and outside. 
        It is our vision to create and maintain this group and put utmost effort to ensure safety and security for all women travellers in this group so that they can enjoy and travel to all new and beautiful unexplored places that had been in their dreams forever.
        A lot of effort is needed to plan and execute a programme especially for a all women group having various age differences on points like safety, security and comfort. You all know we do not plan for common travel destinations but Women’s Travel Club, Kolkata is always keen to discover new places and plan to execute them in a professional way so that our members can have a hassle-free and memorable tour every time. Now, looking at the list of past tour list we feel proud of our achievement as a group in this small span of time.</p>
        I as an admin of this group want to thank all of you for coming together and helping me in building this community.</p>
