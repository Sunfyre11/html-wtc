    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>It all started on the day, 20th January, 2019, a bunch of Facebook friends with a common love to travel got together and went for a tour. Never thought this path will lead to something so big. One trip after another and with my love of writing of travelogues attracted many more friends with a common interest to travel and explore new places. That’s how Facebook group of “Women’s Travel Club” was born in April, 2019.</p>
